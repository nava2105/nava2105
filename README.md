## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm **Nava** (real name Mateo), an **eighth semester student of Information Systems Engineering** at the Central University of Ecuador. Currently, I'm balancing my studies with an **internship in the Anti-Bribery Department of CELEC EP**.

### About Me
- 🔧 **Full Stack Developer:** I enjoy working on full stack projects, building both frontend and backend systems.
- 🧪 **AI Enthusiast:** I love integrating AI APIs into my applications to enhance their functionality.
- 📍 **GitHub Repositories:** Most of the repositories you'll find here are from my university projects, showcasing what the teacher ask us to do in the current semester.

### Hobbies & Interests
- 🌍 **Reading:** I have a passion for reading poetry and philosophy.
- 🎶 **Music:** I enjoy playing various musical instruments, including:
  - Guitar
  - Bass
  - Kalimba
  - Harmonica
  - Ukulele
  - Keyboard
  > Although I've learned to play these instruments, I don't consider myself a pro at any of them—I just enjoy the process of making music!

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate on any exciting projects!
